# FreeRideAdventure

It is a landing page for my friends. They are mountain guides and needed a landing page for new product of their travel company.

What did I do: <br>
    1. Redesigned PSD template.<br>
    2. Made adaptive layout.<br>
    3. Added animation to the portfolio items.<br>
    4. Added animated slider.<br>
    5. Added smooth scroll to block.<br>
    6. Added fixed header when scroll.<br>
    7. Added modal window<br>
